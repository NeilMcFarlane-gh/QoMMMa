ALL:
- More comments added to code for the sake of ease of making future change.
- Indentation has been made more uniform - now uses 4 spaces consistently (NO TABS!).
- Given each file a more meaningful docstring.
- Updated to Python 3.
- The module 'string' was removed entirely, and replaced with base Python as it was causing problems with Python 3.

1. qommma.py

- Error message added for case of defining 0 qm atoms.
- To mimimise accidental invoking of script when importing, __name__ == "__main__" has been used for non-function wrapped code.

2. qomdoc.py

- The whole script has been changed, really. Now uses __doc__ to grep docstrings instead of reading based on string matching - allows more flexibility.
- To mimimise accidental invoking of script when importing, __name__ == "__main__" has been used for non-function wrapped code.

3. qomutil.py

- Some code improvement in the function qmread().

4. gauutil.py

- Option for extra_basis in the B state for MECP calculations has been added.
- Pruned some lines of code in gauout by incorporating more logic statements.

5. jagutil.py

- No particular changes...

6. molutil.py

- Added the total number of atoms into the input file for a normal calculation as it was missing.
- For MECP calculation, split up the execution of jobs for state A and B so that it is easier to find errors.

7. orcautil.py

- Pruned some lines of code in gauout by incorporating more logic statements.
- The extra_basis option was missing from morcainp, so it has been added.

8. qomfreq.py

- No particular changes...
