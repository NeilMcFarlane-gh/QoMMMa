# Project Title

QoMMMa is an additive QM/MM package maintained within the Harvey group at KU Leuven. It uses Tinker for any MM-side calculations, and QM-side calculations can be performed with a variety of quantum chemistry codes including: Gaussian, ORCA, xTB, Jaguar, and Molpro. The source code is written in Fortran90, and Python3 is used as a scripting language to wrap the source code and generate job files for the QM and MM packages.

QoMMMa can perform QM/MM optimisations, reaction pathway optimisations (with nudged elastic band, adiabatic mapping, and growing string method), and frequency analyses. As a code, it is continuously a work-in-progress, but the techniques described above *should* have functionality.
