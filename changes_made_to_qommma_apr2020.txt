1. gauutil.py

The order of sections was changed in gauinp: extra_basis was moved to the end of the Gaussian09 input file.

The same problem was fixed in mgauinp.

A new term "extra_guess" was added in gauinp and mgauinp which allows the modification of the 'Guess' keyword in the Gaussian09 input file (useful for open-shell singlet states).

2. qomfreq.py

The order of sections was changed in qmgauinp: extra_basis was moved to the end of the Gaussian09 input file.

Two extra lines needed to be skipped due to the implementation of dispersion correction in freqmain.

3. orcautil.py

ORCA 4.1.2 can be used in QoMMMa 8.06 with qmcode='orca' for optimization and mecp jobs.	 !!The path has to be set accordingly in the submission script!!
