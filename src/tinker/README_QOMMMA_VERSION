To compile the required executables needed for running qommma,
one needs:

* the full Tinker set of source files.
* qommma-modified versions of the source files:
    - readdiffgrad.f
    - extra.f
    - extra1.f
    - analyze.f
    - prmkey.f

These are called, for convenience, readdiffgrad_qommma.f etc. They do not need
to be copied to anything else - the makefiles below have been edited to incoprorate these names.
Note that although the final Tinker program minimize_qommma.x will be different
from the standard Tinker minimize, the program source file minimize.f itself is not changed!

* The modified file atoms_qommma.i
This should be copied to atoms.i - it is not possible to change all the calls to 'atoms.i' 
  in the Tinker source code!!

* modified makefiles:
    compile.make  library.make  link.make
    for convenience, these are called:
    qommma_compile.make, qommma_library.make, qommma_link.make


Then one needs to do the compilation:
a. It may be necessary as usual with Tinker to check sizes.i to define max number of atoms etc.
b. ./qommma_compile.make (takes some time!)
c. ./qommma_library.make (quick)
d. ./qommma_link.make (quick)

This yields two executables: analyze_qommma.x, and minimize_qommma.x
These need to be copied into the bin directory for qommma, and renamed:
   For v. 8, this should be something like /usr/local/qommma8/bin
    and minimize_qommma.x should be minimize,
        analyze_qommma.x should be analyze_grad
