URGENT:
Change driving coords to prim_constraints (or similar)
Change names of driving arrays etc. to prim constraint arrays etc.
Fix initialize_step.f90 so that it creates a full array of dq (including those which are zero)

Change convergence criteria for gsmphase (specifically for growth)
Edit report file so that it includes the correct convergence criteria for the correct phase
Edit report file so that it includes the constraint details for primitive constraints

Make bin file for reparameterisation of string (work for both growth and opt)
Save primitive definitions in scratch through file write_prim_coord.f90

Make ndlc actually 3N-6, and use ndlc throughout program (NOT IN MODULES)
In main program files (NOT IN MODULES) stop using SIZE(x,1) etc.

Fix check_constrained_atoms.f90 so that it actually works for both primitive and cartesians





LATER:
Integrate all the DLC work into MECP code?
