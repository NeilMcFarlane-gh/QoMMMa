URGENT:
Include options for BOTH gsmtype and gsmphase
Change driving coords to prim_constraints (or similar)
Change convergence criteria for gsmphase (specifically for growth)
Edit report file so that it includes the correct convergence criteria for the correct phase
Make bin file for reparameterisation of string (work for both growth and opt)
Make ndlc actually 3N-6, and use ndlc throughout program (NOT IN MODULES)
Change names of dlc constraint arrays etc. to prim constraint arrays etc.
Change names of driving arrays etc. to prim constraint arrays etc.
In main program files (NOT IN MODULES) stop using SIZE(x,1) etc.
Save primitive definitions in scratch through file write_prim_coord.f90
Fix initialize_step.f90 so that it creates a full array of dq (including those which are zero)
Fix check_constrained_atoms.f90 so that it actually works for both primitive and cartesians
Edit report file so that it includes the constraint details for primitive constraints


LATER:
Integrate all the DLC work into MECP code?
