URGENT:


// F90 //

Fix DLC_to_cart2() - probably to do with B matrix, or evaluation of new dq at each cycle.

Integrate a step-halving type algorithm in update_opt_geometry() so that large/small steps can be taken where necessary.
If the number of traditional primitives is < 3N-6, then flag an error, save the primitives, and say to add additional primitives
Where there are complicated allocation schemes, allocate matrices to be much bigger than they need to
Don't use zero_count, introduce a new prim_type(nprims) array instead
Improve gen_prims_full to generate angles better such that duplicates are not added
Allocate important arrays outwith subroutines (not functions), and don't pass too much (or anything) to subroutines
Fix check_constrained_atoms.f90 so that it actually works for primitive

// PYTHON //

Allow additional prims in input files
Merge gsm.in and qommma.in into one file
Remove all the GSM running code from qommma.py and add to functions SE_gsm() and DE_gsm() in gsmutil.py



LATER:

Integrate all the DLC work into MECP code

Allow for GSM with cartesian coordinates

Remove NEB from F90 and create nebutil.py like gsmutil.py
Integrate all the DLC work into NEB code

Create adiabatic mapping procedures in adiabutil.py like gsmutil.py and nebutil.py

Update manual, readme, qomdoc
