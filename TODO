URGENT:


// F90 //

Fix DLC_to_cart2() - probably to do with B matrix, or evaluation of new dq at each cycle.
(LINKED WITH ***) When in optimisation phase OR DE-GSM, primitive internal coordinates don't need to be renumbered in initialise_prims.f90. ***
Check where unproj_cons() should be used...
Integrate a step-halving type algorithm in update_opt_geometry() so that large/small steps can be taken where necessary.
If the number of traditional primitives is < 3N-6, then tell the user OR add additional bonds until 3N-6 is reached

// PYTHON //

(LINKED WITH ***) When in optimisation phase OR DE-GSM, read in primitives from the files prim_list & prims. ***

Allow additional prims in input 



LATER:
Fix check_constrained_atoms.f90 so that it actually works for primitive
Integrate all the DLC work into MECP code?
Integrate all the DLC work into NEB code?
Allow for GSM with cartesian coordinates?
